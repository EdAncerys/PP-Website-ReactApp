              The app aims to solve the problem of the user who wants to find a
              circular route for outdoor activities (walking, cycling, hiking).
              The user can view the map and search for routes without logging
              in, either circular routes or routes between a start and end
              point. Different activity types can be selected, and the result
              can be randomized. Once the user is logged in, favorite routes can
              be saved in My Routes and can be viewed on the map, or they can be
              removed from the list.

              in which case no planes can land or take off. Here are some of the

            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small
              inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly
              innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest
              goods. Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in
              quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in
              place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a
              no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.
              Your task is to add the new feature to our system so that we can
              begin selling a new category of items.
            </div>
            <div>First an introduction to our system:</div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we
              have to sell the item.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item
              is.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every
              item.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast.
            </div>
            <div>The Quality of an item is never negative.</div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets.
            </div>
            <div>The Quality of an item is never more than 50.</div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or
              decreases in Quality.
            </div>
            <div style={styles.paragraph}>
              "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as it's
              SellIn value approaches; Quality increases by 2 when there are 10
              days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but Quality
              drops to 0 after the concert "Conjured" items degrade in Quality
              twice as fast as normal items.
